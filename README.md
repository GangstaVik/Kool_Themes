# KOOL THEMES  
A small (for now) collection of custom themes for Discord, browsers, and random apps — part of my journey to improve at CSS and front-end aesthetics.  
Expect neon, sleek lines, and wallpapers that look like they’ve been ripped straight out of a cyberpunk fever dream.


## 🚀 What This Repository Is  
Experiments, prototypes, custom themes, UI sketches — basically a playground where I break and fix CSS until it stops screaming.  
If you're a dev who loves dark themes, neon energy, or clean UI:  
**you’re welcome to steal, fork, break, improve, or vibe with anything here.**

## 🎯 Goals
- sharpen my CSS design skills  
- explore UI/UX patterns  
- create aesthetic, customizable themes  
- document my learning journey  
- build “kool” stuff for fun

## 🙌 CREDITS
Without these legends, this repo wouldn’t look half as good:

### **ClearVision Team**
For being fully open-source and letting creators like me use their theme as a foundation for experiments and reskins.  
Their work = S-tier.

### **Wallhaven.cc**
For hosting the wallpaper used as the main background of the first theme.  
If it gives cyberpunk energy or Shinkai melancholy… it probably came from there.

## 🧪 Dev Notes
This repo may contain:
- unfinished prototypes  
- CSS hacks I should not be proud of  
- over-commented experiments  
- absolutely cursed snippets  

…because learning requires chaos.

## ✨ Final Note
If a theme here makes even *one* person say  
**“damn, that looks clean as hell”**  
then the mission is already a W.
